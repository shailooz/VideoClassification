# VideoClassification
This repo have three deep learning solutions for general video classification problem

1. A 3D CNN approch
2. A Transfer Learning + LSTM approch
3. A CNN + Time distributed LSTM approch
            
The folder 'dataset' won't be there in repo, so create one at you working directory
The programs are maintaned as python notebook

How to run the classifiers?

1. Create a folder dataset
2. Run download_dataset.py(it will dowload the dataset in dataset folder)
3. Run the python notebook corresponding to the required model.
